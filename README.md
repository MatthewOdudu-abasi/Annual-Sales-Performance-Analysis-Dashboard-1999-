## Project Overview

This project represents **my very first analytical project built using Power BI**, marking the beginning of my journey into data analytics and business intelligence. I am excited to share this project because it demonstrates my foundational understanding of data modeling, KPI creation, interactive filtering, and visual storytelling using Power BI.

The dashboard was designed to support an **Annual General Meeting (AGM)** by providing a clear, executive-friendly summary of sales performance for the year 1999. It focuses on revenue generation, shipping costs, regional performance, customer contribution, city-level distribution, and salesperson effectiveness.

---

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze organizational sales performance for the year 1999 and present insights in a clear and intuitive dashboard. The analysis enables stakeholders to understand:

- Overall revenue performance  
- Cost implications through shipping fees  
- Regional and city-level revenue distribution  
- Customer and salesperson contribution to total revenue  
- Relationships between revenue, profit, and unit price  

---

## Problem Statement

Management requires a consolidated analytical view of sales performance to support strategic decision-making during the Annual General Meeting. Specifically, there is a need to:

- Quantify total revenue generated in 1999  
- Understand average shipping costs and their impact on profitability  
- Identify top-performing regions, customers, and salespersons  
- Compare revenue and profit trends across regions  

Without an analytical dashboard, these insights remain fragmented across raw transactional data.

---

## Pre-Analysis Questions

- What is the total revenue generated in 1999?  
- What is the average shipping fee across all orders?  
- Which region contributes the most to revenue and profit?  
- Who are the top revenue-generating customers?  
- Which salespersons drive the highest revenue?  
- How does revenue vary across cities and regions?  

---

## Key KPIs

From the dashboard:

- **Total Revenue:** 435.04K  
- **Average Shipping Fee:** 118.33  

These KPIs establish the overall scale of business performance and logistics cost exposure for the year.

## Story of the Data

The dataset represents sales transactions for the year 1999, capturing revenue, profit, unit price, shipping fees, customer names, regions, cities, and salesperson information. Through visualization, the data tells a story of uneven regional performance, revenue concentration among key customers, and strong dependence on top-performing salespersons.

## Data Analysis & Insight Extraction

### In-Analysis Board (Analytical Workflow)

The analysis begins with KPI cards to establish high-level performance context, followed by deeper exploration across:

- Customers  
- Regions  
- Cities  
- Salespersons  
- Revenue, profit, and unit price relationships  

Interactive region slicers allow stakeholders to dynamically filter the dashboard and explore region-specific insights.

## Chart Descriptions and Observations

### Average Shipping Fee (KPI Card)
- Displays an average shipping fee of **118.33**  
- Indicates that logistics costs are significant and may affect profitability  

### Total Revenue (KPI Card)
- Shows total revenue of **435.04K**  
- Serves as the headline performance metric for the AGM  

### Revenue by Customer (Bar Chart)
Top customers by revenue contribution:
- Company D (~67K)  
- Company H (~50K)  
- Company BB (~44K)  
- Company F (~38K)  
- Company A (~37K)  

Revenue is concentrated among a small number of customers, indicating strong account value but potential dependency risk.

### Revenue, Profit, and Unit Price by Region (Line Chart)
- **North:** ~140K (highest)  
- **East:** ~110K  
- **South:** ~95K  
- **West:** ~90K  

Unit price remains relatively stable across regions, while revenue and profit decline from North to West.

### Revenue by Region (Horizontal Bar Chart)
- North: 141.66K  
- East: 108.28K  
- South: 93.85K  
- West: 91.25K  

The North region is the primary revenue driver.

### Revenue by City (Map Visualization)
Revenue is distributed across multiple U.S. cities, with higher concentrations in economically active regions.

### Revenue by Salesperson (Treemap)
Top contributors include **Nancy Freehafer**, **Andrew Cencini**, and **Anne Larsen**. Sales performance is uneven, with top performers driving a disproportionate share of revenue.

---

## Key Patterns and Insights

- Revenue and profit are strongly region-dependent  
- The North region consistently outperforms others  
- A small group of customers and salespersons drive most revenue  
- Shipping costs are non-trivial and should be closely monitored  
- City-level performance aligns with economic activity  

---

## Detailed Observations

- Total revenue of **435.04K** reflects solid annual performance  
- Over **140K** of revenue comes from the North region alone  
- Customer concentration presents both opportunity and risk  
- Individual salesperson effectiveness significantly influences outcomes  

---

## Recommendations

### Revenue Optimization
- Strengthen relationships with top customers  
- Diversify the customer base to reduce dependency  

### Regional Strategy
- Identify and replicate successful practices from the North region  
- Improve sales execution in East, South, and West regions  

### Sales Team Development
- Recognize and retain high-performing salespersons  
- Introduce mentorship programs led by top performers  

### Cost Management
- Review shipping fee structures  
- Explore logistics optimization opportunities  

### Analytics Expansion
- Use Power BI dashboards for recurring performance reviews  
- Extend analysis to include multi-year comparisons

## Conclusion

This project represents **my very first analytical project using Power BI** and demonstrates my ability to convert raw sales data into clear, actionable business insights through data visualization. The dashboard supports executive decision-making by presenting revenue, cost, customer, regional, and salesperson insights in an interactive format.

I am excited to share this project as part of my portfolio, as it reflects both my analytical foundation and my growing proficiency in Power BI and data storytelling.
